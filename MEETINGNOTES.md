- Reviewed KillVillager, VotePlayer, BeginIntro, and NewGame use cases
- Fixed data access interfaces to adhere to SRP

### To do:
- Interface Adapters (Controller/Presenter)
- Write ConversationDataAccessObject/GameDataAccessObject 
  - note: conversation could be txt not csv
- Use cases: View Role, Check Win
  - Should check win be its own use case? (Ethan)
- Working UI soon
- Testing?
